# Rubik's Cube Solver

- This application simulates a Rubik's cube, allowing you to scramble it and make turns, as well as solve a
user given Rubik's cube.
- Anyone interested in Rubik's cube may use this
- This project is of interest to me because I've never been able to solve Rubik's cube before, so I want to create this
application to solve it for me
